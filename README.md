# Design code data

This repo is used to store some design code data we seeded in partnership with the [Office for Place](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-place).

We seeded the data to test the emerging [design code specification](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/design-code/).

We will publish this indicative data on [planning.data.gov.uk](planning.data.gov.uk√ç) for data consumers to test.
